Pompeii will use an algorithm to generate procedural environments for game content as opposed to relying on on map builders.

## Method

I have installed the planet generator from [here](http://topps.diku.dk/torbenm/maps.msp) on atlanta-dev in`/home/jason.hamilton/projects/sandbox/planet_generator/planet/planet`

so we can generate space-view maps.  Next is to import those as textures around a sphere in Godot/Blender and make planets.
